How come all the important realizations come to us too late? Ones about time and self and all those messy ones about love? I remember making forts when we were four and you always teasing me the least; how you were the only boy to wash his hands and say thank you to whoever’s mom opened their cupboards that day.

So many days with you have gone missing, so many feelings except the one I had when you told me I was beautiful. No one before or since has said it with such innocence and without expectation of anything in return. I’m sorry I never gave you anything in return. We all came to say goodbye to you with the casket closed. I think I stopped breathing that day and I make wishes on every Sweet William flower I see, hoping you’re somewhere knowing I wanted to give you so much in return.

Then again, I think you realized that a long time ago.
 
Wishing you were here again, if only for a moment.
