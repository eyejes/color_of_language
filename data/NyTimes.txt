THE five boroughs of New York have more than 23,000 restaurants. The restaurants themselves draw the obsessive attention of critics, foodies, diners and health inspectors. But what of the tenants who live above them, the unsung army of city residents who associate home with the smell of sautéed clams and garlic, baking bread, lamb vindaloo?

They occupy a peculiar niche in a city full of peculiar niches, where the primal drive to obtain living space can force the marriage of tenant and trattoria. Downstairs, unsuspecting diners look at menus and order. Overhead, tenants pursue an experiment in living that comes in nearly as many varieties as there are pizza toppings at Otto.

At the Alwyn Court, the sumptuous rococo landmark at Seventh and 58th, the street-level restaurant happens to be Petrossian, the deluxe caviar house. It has its advantages. Residents enjoy a discount, and with a quick call to the restaurant manager they can slip in through a private entrance from the lobby. This year, the restaurant served hors d’oeuvres at the building’s annual holiday party.

It’s a nice way to live.
